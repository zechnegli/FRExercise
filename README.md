# FRExercise
# Install guile
Run "pod install" to install all dependencies


1. I use the MVC design pattern to do this exercise. If the view controller grows to a very large, I will make it transition to MVVM with Rxswift 
2. For the network layer, I use alamofire in the custom generic class.
3. For the data persistence, I use core data to store the liked event.
4. For the UI design, I create all the UI programmatically because in the real production, it will be convenient in terms of team cooperation.
5. I use dependency injection to test the Coredata layer class.
